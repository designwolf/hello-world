# hello-world
A project that teaches me how to use github
My name is Travis Vaught. I am a senior at the University of Georgia.
I am learning to use Github for the first time.
I aspire to create an app for Android Auto by the end of the semester.
This will be interesting because I've never written Java before
But I have written Swift, C#, and HTML/CSS/PHP
